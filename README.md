# Work Day Scheduler

This work day scheduler was built using HTML and JavaScript (in particular, JQuery), as well as CSS which was provided to me. Originally my instructor provided some starter code, but it proved to be too advanced for my understanding of JQuery, so I decided to dial it back a bit and build up the HTML myself. The application itself is meant to allow the user to schedule between the hours of 9AM and 5PM, to help create new tasks, as well as keep track of them over the course of the day. In this challenge, I again had trouble getting local storage to cooperate with me, so as it is now the app does not work as intended
